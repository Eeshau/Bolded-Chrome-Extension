# Bolded-Chrome-Extension
Chrome extension that bolds the first few letters of words to make reading easier. Similar to trademarked Bionic reading and Jiffy Reader. Won't work on shadow rooted content but will work on all other text on any webpage excluding Google webpages.


# Try it out
Go to chrome://extensions/  
Load unpacked and select this folder   
Open any page other than Google, say Wikipedia for example
